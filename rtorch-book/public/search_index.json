If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Note. For the labels, do not use underscore _ or dash -; they will confuse bookdown referencing. Example: avoid linear_algebra or linear-algebra as labels. Preferrably, use one word. Figures and Tables with references Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 9.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 9.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 9.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 9.1: Here is a nice table!

Just like this: (ref:ALongCaption) **A base plot of pressure vs. temperature**. This plot shows the pressure readings at different temperatures. The initial temperature, $t_0$, is nearer to the intersection of the axis. Then, in the caption reference copy the tag (ref:ALongCaption) enclosing it in quotes or single quotes. Figure 9.2: A base plot of pressure vs.Â temperature. This plot shows the pressure readings at different temperatures. The initial temperature, \\(t_0\\), is nearer to the intersection of the axis. With tables, do the same with long captions. (ref:TabLongCaption) The following table shows the numerical data for the sepal and petal measurements. And then insert the tag reference where the caption should go enclosed in quotes or single quotes. Table 9.2: The following table shows the numerical data for the sepal and petal measurements.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2019) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "]
